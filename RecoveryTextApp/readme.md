# What is this folder for?
This folder is used to store files of the RecoveryTextApp.
## Why is this folder NOT visible in the main branch, but in the RecoveryTextApp branch?
This is not to mess the main branch. This way, the folder and its content is a bit "hidden" from public, too.
## Is the content confidential?
No. The content of files will store just the latest prod & test versions. They will be updated by the RecoveryTextApp's build pipelines whenever a new version of the app is released to Test or Prod.
